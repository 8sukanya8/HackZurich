# HackZurich
# Inspiration
Because of our hectic lifestyle, we do not always keep track of what we eat. But as the old saying goes, you are what you eat. We are picky eaters and android developers. So we combined the two defining traits and conjured an application that helped us to track and improve out eating habits in a quick and easy fashion.

# How we did it
We explored a sea of APIs to find the perfect match for our project. We chose google vision API as our API as it helps us identify the food that the user is consuming. The user simply takes a picture of the food with our app. By using these labels, the app evaluates how healthy you are eating by giving you a score. By averaging your records over a preterdetermined time interval, the app will advise you as to what you can do to improve your health.

# Challenges we ran into
It was difficult for us to find the right API for the project. Additionally, sending image files to the google API was definitely also a challenge, as it involves certain encoding and concepts that we are not familar with.

# Accomplishments we are proud of
We have succesfully created a working prototype that does what we wanted it to do in merely 2 days. We are proud of the scoreboard that is intuitive and user-friendly. We also managed to combine our ideas with flying colours.
